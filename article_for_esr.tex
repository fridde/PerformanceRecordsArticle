\textbf{\emph{Note: Old abstract, taken from Master Thesis}}

Crude oil plays an important role for the global energy system. As there is ample evidence that conventional oil production will have peaked by 2020, unconventional oil has attained a stronger focus. In particular, oil derived from bitumen from Canadian oil sands has been proposed as a possible remedy to global oil depletion. 

This study aims to test the hypothesis that forecasts on the Canadian oil sands published between about 2000 and 2010 have been overestimating production significantly.
A large compilation of oil sands projects, prognoses and production data has been established using openly available databases and reports. Conversion, standardization and analysis of the data was done using the statistical programming language R. The resulting programming code and databases have been compiled into a package available free and open-source online.

The statistical analysis shows a significant bias of the prognoses towards an overestimation of oil sands production. The compilation shows that most authors tend to overestimate the rate of expansion of the industry. Therefore, any prognosis on the expansion of the industry should be examined thoroughly before use.

%Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article, using superscript Arabic numbers.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Oil produced from Canadian oil sands has been pointed out as a possible remedy to mitigate a future decline of conventional oil production. 
Since the so-called \emph{Hirsch-report} \citep{hirsch_peaking_2005}, which proposed the further expansion of the industry as a means to sustain global economic welfare, numerous articles, publications and comments have been submitted to the public for evaluation.  
Among these are several outlooks and prognoses for the future development of the oil sands industry.

However, these prognoses  are rarely made accountable for their performance compared to the actual course of events later on. 
Since energy strategic decisions heavily rely on the choice of the prognosis that supports the decision, informed choices should evaluate the performance of earlier prognoses made with the same model.

Surprisingly, performance ratings of historical prognoses have not been established as a standard tool when choosing a model, and, in fact, do not exist for most of the models.

This article evaluates the performance of several prognoses made on the development of the production from Canadian oil sands made between 2000 and 2012. 
It shows that prognoses have tended to overestimate production vastly. 
It furthermore attempts to visualize the performance ratings by \emph{"correcting"} recent prognoses, assuming similar ratings.

Finally, the article discusses the need for more open models and recommends including the evaluation of performance ratings of earlier prognoses of a model into deciding upon energy strategies.


\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
For this article, 19 sources have been reviewed. These can be seen in table \ref{tab:SourcesOfData}.  


\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{[include short descriptions of the sources]}
\item description of data-collection, conversion, interpolation
\item short description of mathematical model for performance ratings (mean deviation, time lapse, growth deviation, error as a function of time, etc) 
\item short description of application of performance ratings of \emph{"old"} prognoses to recent prognoses
\end{itemize}

Mention: Since no source has disclosed details as of how the prognoses were made, the forecasting models were assumed to remain constant over time within each affiliated institution. 
This is the closest guess, but can of course be proven wrong by the respective institution by simply publishing the changes of their models between publication dates.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item limitations of the calculations and assumptions within this article
	\item lack of insight into models of respective institutions 
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Why? general bias? Purely industrial interests in the prognoses?
			\item Can this be changed? Need for \emph{open models} that can be peer-reviewed and reproduced!
			\item Appeal to consult performance ratings before relying on a prognosis
	\end{itemize}
